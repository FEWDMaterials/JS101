The difference is that compiled languages need a step where the source code is physically transformed into machine code. However, with an interpreted language, this additional step is **excluded** in favor of **parsing** and **executing** the source code directly when the program is run.\n\n#### How programs are written\n---\n\nAll programs are composed with a collection of **fundamental** concepts that, when combined, can essentially dictate a wide variety of tasks a computer can perform.\n\nHere are a collection of these most important concepts:\n\n* **Declarations**: typically, we can store and retrieve data in our programs by associating them with intermediary values that we call **variables**\n* **Expressions**: we use expressions to evaluate stuff. For example, **`2 + 2`** is an example of an expression that will **evaluate** a value, namely 4. \n* **NOTE**: typically we can use expressions and declarations in tandem to perform complex tasks. For instance, we can reference a variable we declared in an expression to help us evaluate new values which can then be stored.\n* **Statements**: statements will use expressions and declarations to alternate a program's **control flow**, which is essentially the order in which declarations, expressions, and other statements are executed.\n\nAside from these fundamental concepts, we also talk a lot about this idea of **algorithms**. An **algorithm** is simple a series of declarations, expressions, and statements that can be used over and over again to solve well defined problems of a certain type.\n\nFor example, we can implement an algorithm that converts temperature from **fahrenheit** to **celsius**. It would look something like this:\n\n1. **Declare** F = 32;\n2. **Expression** ( **F** - 32 ) / 1.8;\n3. **Declare** C = **Evaluated** expression from **[2]**\n\nThis is a form of **pseudo** code where we define the steps a computer program &mdash; **any** &mdash; computer program can take to convert **fahrenheit** to **celsius**.\n\nThe beauty of programming is that all of it revolves around the same key set of concepts and ideas. For this reason, we do not need to specify any **particular programming language** when discussing the functional aspects of a program.\n\n#### Define: Programming languages\n---\n\nA programming language is a series of **grammar** and **rules** that we can define towards writing source code.\n\nLanguages are effectively different approaches towards communicating the same ideas in programming. Essentially, we can communicate in say both **French** and **English**, what mainly differs is the structure of our sentences and the actual words and sounds themselves.\n\nThe **same analogy** can be made with programming languages.\n\n#### Examples of programming languages\n---\n\nThere are many. Way too many. \n\nHere are some of the most popular ones, though.\n\n1. **JavaScript**: this language is interpreted.\n2. **Python**: this language is interpreted.\n3. **Java**: this language is compiled\n4. **Ruby**: this language is interpreted.\n5. **C/C++**: this language is compiled.\n\nThese languages all build on the same concepts defined above; the main difference lies in **how** they are run (compiled vs interpreted) and also **how** they are used. \n\nIn general, anything programmable can be programmed in each of the languages defined above. However, some languages are better suited for certain tasks above others. \n\nFor example, to perform web programming on the front-end, you'll want to write JavaScript. This is because all browsers collectively support running javascript within it's environment. \n\n#### What is web development?\n---\nThe use of programming languages and concepts towards producing a system that listens to user requests over the internet and serves back HTML, CSS, and interaction code to the client.\n\n#### What is the difference between a web site and web app\n---\nWeb sites are more **static**. Think of them as sort of like interactive brochures. They typically don't hold any state and are usually just information.\n\nA web app is more like an iOS or Android app. It holds state, does not refresh itself and in general **does something** vs **showing something**.\n\n#### What are the stages of web development\n---\n\nDepends on the methodology used by team. Typically, there is a UX phase, a Design phase, a Development phase bundled with extensive QA. This was the process used in the consulting firm I used to work in.\n\nFor a startup, the process is similar, however there is a lot more room for iteration and testing out ideas by putting something up for users to use and deliver feedback.\n\n#### What is the difference between front-end and back-end web development\n---\n**Front end**: Client side interactions and structure. This includes stuff like iOS apps and whatever you load in browser.\n\n**Back end**: Server side, data storage and retrival. Needs a client **of some sort** (not necessarily a browser) to work. Deals with storing and retriving information.\n\n#### Main Class Deliverable\n---\n\nIn order to explore the core concepts of this class and achieve our learning objectives, we will recreate the **traditional resume template** for the web.\n\n#### Key Requirements\n---\n\n* Template should resemble the typical resume.pdf we all maintain\n* Template should use tasteful CSS3 styles to accentuate key peices of information and design principles\n* Template should work across all screens including (and specifically) mobile\n* Template should be **printer friendly** and take up exactly one page  when printed. \n\nHere is an **[example](http://resume.taqquikarim.com/)**.\n\n<!--\n**IMPORTANT**: These definitions are **intentionally** super lightweight. Best way to learn programming concepts is by actually programming. You will pick up a vastly larger number of concepts and vocabulary when we start building websites from scratch. For this reason, I tried to keep this portion of the class as minimal as possible.\n\n#### What can you build with various languages?\n---\nBasically, anything. You can use programming languages to configure hardware, build websites, build mobile apps, desktop programs, server monitoring systems. Literally, anything.\n\n#### What is web development?\n---\nThe use of programming languages and concepts towards producing a system that listens to user requests over the internet and serves back HTML, CSS, and interaction code to the client.\n\n#### What is the difference between a web site and web app\n---\nWeb sites are more **static**.

What can we do with javascript code?\n\n#### What is JavaScript\n---\nOriginally called **Mocha**, then **LiveScript**, then renamed to **JavaScript**.\n\n2. It's a subclass of ECMAScript, a standardization maintained by Ecma International\n3. Basically, Ecma is the **Webster's Dictionary** of JavaScript\n\n### What can you do with Javascript?\n\nJavaScript runs in the <strong>browser</strong>, meaning it is used heavily in user-interaction.\nIn other words, with javascript, you can...\n\n#### Animate stuff\n---\nYou can use javascript to create for example an infinite random prop loop.\n\n<iframe scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/mottaquikarim/embed/jgIbd/?height=268&theme-id=820&default-tab=result' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='min-height: 268px !important;'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/mottaquikarim/pen/jgIbd/'>jQuery Random Height/Width</a> by Mottaqui Karim (<a href='http://codepen.io/mottaquikarim'>@mottaquikarim</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.\n</iframe>\n\n#### Allow the user to control stuff\n---\nYou can allow the user to take control of a UI element and dictate its state.\n\n<iframe height=\"300\" src=\"//jsfiddle.net/2jwnjwfd/1/embedded/result\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n#### Mess with people's minds\n---\nThis is just a pretty cool masking example that is actually pretty hard to pull off with web dev tech (but can be done, as shown here thanks to javascript).\n\n(**FYI**: this formed the basis of [this website](http://maveron.com/) that I built back in the day).\n\n<iframe scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/mottaquikarim/embed/DABIG/?height=268&theme-id=820&default-tab=result' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='min-height: 268px !important;'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/mottaquikarim/pen/DABIG/'>Mask Effect demo</a> by Mottaqui Karim (<a href='http://codepen.io/mottaquikarim'>@mottaquikarim</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.\n</iframe>\n\n#### Determine the state of something on a page in real time\n---\nWe are using something called conditionals here.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" style=\"height: 400px;\" src=\"//jsfiddle.net/hrfq4qrj/1/embedded/result\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n#### Load in data dynamically (this is the best one)\n---\nBasically, we can interact with API data without ever reloading the page!","idx":4},"linking-js-to-html":{"content":"# Linking JS To HTML\n---\n\nHow can we actually include JS to our webpages?\n\n#### Learning Objectives\n---\n1. How can we load JS into our webpages?\n2. How can we push our webpages to the internet?\n\n#### Linking to Javascript\n---\nAll javascript files on the frontend are loaded within HTML code itself.\n\n**How do we set up javascript to run in the browser?**\n\n1. The precedent is similar to what we do to link CSS files &mdash; we employ a tag to tell the HTML page where the javascript code for that page lives.\n\n2. However, we do NOT use the link tag...\n\n3. Instead, we do the following:\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n\t<head>\n\t\t<!-- Do NOT link to your javascript here -->\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\n\t\t<script src=\"PATH_TO_YOUR_JS_FILE\"></script>\n\t</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**NOTE the `<script>` tag**\n\n1. This is a new tag we have never seen before; remember that the `<link>` tag is for CSS files and the `<script>` tag is for javascript files (for now).\n2. the `src` attribute is what we use to link to the external js file\n3. remember to CLOSE your script tag, unlike the `<link>` tag, `<script>` is NOT self closing!\n\n**Commenting + ( basic debugging of ) code in JavaScript**\n\n```js\n\n// this is an inline comment\n\nconsole.log('You can write debugging statements like so');\n\n/*\n\tthis\n\t\tis\n\t\t\ta\n\t\t\t\tmultilined\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcomment\n*/\n```\n\n## Side note: deploying HTML pages\n\n**Learning objective**: Understand the significance of Git and why GitHub is relevant to our interests.\n\n---\n\nSo at this point, we have a good sense of **how** an HTTP request works, but the main question that remains is this: **how do we get our webpage to the internets?!**\n\nTo answer this question, we must do two things: \n\n1. Build our own simple HTML page\n2. Push it to GitHub.\n\n#### Building a basic HTML page\n---\nAt this point, we know that the server from our last section (say, **Google's** server) will return to us a response that is encoded in a specific way (a **language** if you will).\n\nBut! **Where is this data stored?**\n\nAs it turns out, it is stored in files and folders, in the same way we store data on our computers.\n\nSo in order for us to \"build\" our own HTML page, we must do two things:\n\n1. Create a folder to store our HTML data\n2. Create a file **within that folder** and write out HTML.\n\n#### Pushing to GitHub\n---\n\nOk, now we have an HTML page! And get this: we can even load it in Chrome and see it rendered! How do we get this online?\n\nIn one word: **GitHub**.\n\n#### What is GitHub anyways?\n---\n\nGitHub is a service that allows developers to **push** their local **git repositories** online. As a courtesy, they also have their own server that will **host** HTML/CSS/JavaScript files that are found in the pushed repos.\n\nBut first, a few definitions:\n\n#### Git\n---\nGit is an open source software that allows developers to collaborate on large software projects. \n\nWith Git, developers can **commit** code at certain checkpoints. So for example, if you are building a website that requires:\n\n1. a form,\n2. a slideshow,\n3. and a server request, \n\nYou would implement the form then **commit** that code. Then, you would implement the slideshow and **commit**. Finally, you would implement the server requestand **commit** once more. \n\nThis is useful because if, for any reason your updates to the slideshow breaks your form code, you can easily **roll back** to your last commit (the form implementation) and that code would remain pristine and unbroken. \n\n#### Git Repository \n---\nWhen you take a piece of code and start tracking it with Git, you are turning it into a git **repository**. Your git repository will store all your commits, keep track of your code, give you commands that allow you to roll back to a previous commit, etc.\n\n#### Pushing to GitHub\n---\n\nThe final piece is this: your awesome git repo has let's say 500 commits on it. This is awesome! \n\nBut now calamity strikes! Your computer inexplicably dies the morning of your big presentation. Here's the main question: **are you screwed?**\n\nIn one word: **Yes**. \n\nIncidentally, this is **exactly** the problem GitHUb solves. As it turns out, Git allows you to **push** your git repos to other places. Either your friends computer, or your spare home computer, etc. GitHub is basically a cloud storage system that lets you store your git repos online for **free** and also share it with other developers.\n\n\n","idx":5},"javascript-basics":{"content":"# Javascript Basics\n---\n\nTime to write some code!\n\n## [JS Global Notes](http://samantha.fewd.us/#fork/mottaquikarim/JS101) | [LIVE Instructor View](http://samantha.fewd.us/#broadcast/mottaquikarim/JS101)\nGeneral class notes.\n\n#### Learning Objectives\n---\n1. What are the different ways we can store, retrieve, and use data in javascript?\n\n#### Exercise\n---\n\nWe want to learn enough javascript to be able to solve the following PSET.\n\n#### [Basic Vars Review](http://samantha.fewd.us/#fork/mottaquikarim/Basic_Vars_Review) | [LIVE Instructor View](http://samantha.fewd.us/#broadcast/mottaquikarim/Basic_Vars_Review)\n\nThis will help you get your fingers warm re: simple javascript variable declarations.\n\n#### Types of Variables\n---\n\nA variable type is a way to classify the different kinds of data we can save to a variable. There are exactly 6 types of variables:\n\n#### Primitives\n\n* `undefined`\n* `null`\n* boolean\n* number\n* string\n\n#### Non Primitive\n\n* Object\n\n### Primitives\n\nA Primitive type is a most basic bit of information that you can store. For example, a number is a primitive because it cannot be made up of any of the other types of variables\n\n<strong>Alternate definition</strong>: Think of this as an atom -- atoms are atoms because we cannot break them down into any more basic bits, same goes for primitives\n\n#### `undefined`\n\nUndefined is the default state of any variable. Basically means the variable is empty or has not yet been assigned a value, primitive or otherwise\n\n#### `null`\n\nThe null variable is different from the `undefined` type, but only subtly so.\n\n1. the `null` type is assigned to a variable, but its \"value\" is empty.\n2. the `undefined` type is by default the value of each variable that is declared but not defined\n3. &#35;esoteric\n\n**[Example](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/5131)**\n\n#### Booleans\n\nTrue or false. Basically.\n\n```javascript\nvar myBooleanValue = true; // true\nvar myBooleanValueThatIsFalse = false; // false\nconsole.log( typeof myBooleanValue );\n```\n\n#### Numbers\n\nNumeric values that can be operated upon via the standard rules of arithmetic.\n\n```javascript\nvar myNumber = 1;\nvar pi = 3.14159; // ...approximately\n```\n\n\n#### Strings\n\nThis one is interesting, we use this to represent text. Anything between the quotations (double or single, doesn't matter as long as you are consistent) is treated as a number.\n\nSo...\n\n```javascript\nvar myName = 'Taq Karim';\nvar dudeThisIsAString = '105';\n\nvar doubleQuotesRCool2 = \"Look ma! I'm double quoted\";\n```\n\n### Non-Primitives or: how I learned to stop worrying and Love the Object.\n\nObjects are the bees-knees yo.\n\n<div>Seriously.</div>\n\n<strong>Objects are a collection of properties where each property is a primitive type</strong>.\n\n#### In other words...\n```javascript\n// just primitives\nvar someNumber = 1;\nvar someBool = false;\nvar someNullItem = null;\n\n\n// as an object...\nvar myObject = {\n\tsomeNumber: 1\n\t, someBool: false\n\t, someNullItem: null\n}; // notice the use of \":\" instead of \"=\"\n\n// to access these items:\nconsole.log( myObject.someNumber );\nconsole.log( myObject.someBool );\n```\n","idx":6},"functions-and-conditionals":{"content":"# Functions and Conditionals\n---\nLet's learn to actually do stuff with javascript now. Functions and conditionals well help us automate programming tasks and also build in decision making capabilities into our programs.\n\n## [JS Global Notes](http://samantha.fewd.us/#fork/mottaquikarim/JS101) | [LIVE Instructor View](http://samantha.fewd.us/#broadcast/mottaquikarim/JS101)\nGeneral class notes.\n\n\n#### Learning Objectives\n---\n1.
